 
 | Signal | [unit] | description | 
 | --- | --- | --- | 
 | sample_time | [s] | time since epoch in  (according to computer running micro service) | 
 | Tar_Dist_rms | [m] | Target range standard deviation | 
 | Tar_Ang_rms | [deg] | Target angle standard deviation | 
 | Tar_Vrel_rms | [m/s] | Target relative velocity standard deviation (to/from radar) | 
 | Tar_Vrel | [m/s] | Target relative velocity (to/from radar; positive likely towards radar, negative away from) | 
 | Tar_Dist | [m] | Target range | 
 | Tar_PdH0 | [%] | Target false alarm probability | 
 | Tar_Length | [m] | Target length (likely range direction) | 
 | Tar_Width | [m] | Target width (likely azimuth direction) | 
 | Tar_Type | [N/A] | Target type -  0:No target, 1:Oncoming, 2:Stationary, 3:Traced (targets moving in the same direction) | 
 | Tar_Ang_stat | [N/A] | Target angle status - 0:Expanded target, 1:Point target, 2:Digital, 3:Invalid (should be ignored, because it is invalid) | 
 | Tar_Ang | [deg] | Target angle | 
 | Tar_RCSValue | [dBm2] | Radar cross section |
